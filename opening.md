When the human genome was sequenced more than a decade ago, people thought that we obtained the language of life. However, it turns out that this is not a language we understand! Our research goal is to apply computational models/methods to decypher the language of life. The methods/tools we use include: advanced data structures, general algorithm design, machine learning methods, applied deep learning, data mining techniques, graph theories etc. You will be trained to handle BIG genomic data and solve high-impact research problems. The training will provide you with ample career opportunities.

- You should have traininings from Computer Science, Data Science, Electronic Engineering, BME, Bioinformatics, Statistics, or related fields
- Importantly, you need to be famialr with some programming languages. C/C++, or Python is a big plus.
- You should have strong curiosity for the research problems and are highly motivated to search for answers.
- To apply, please specify me as your advisor so that I can keep an eye on your application.
- If you have any questions, feel free to drop me a message.
