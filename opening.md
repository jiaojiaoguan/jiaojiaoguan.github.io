### Postdoc and Research Assistant (RA) openings

Group: Dr. Yanni Sun, Electrical Engineering at City University of Hong Kong 

When the human genome was sequenced more than a decade ago, people thought that we obtained the language of life. However, it turns out that this is not a language we understand! Our research goal is to apply computational models/methods to decypher the language of life. The methods/tools we use include: advanced data structures, general algorithm design, machine learning methods, applied deep learning, data mining techniques, graph theories etc. You will be trained to handle BIG genomic data and solve high-impact research problems. The training will provide you with ample career opportunities.

### Research area and projects: 

- Bioinformatics: sequence analysis, plant genome annotation
- Deep learning-based virus composition analysis, virus host prediction, and virus classification. 
- Metagenomic analysis: strain-level composition
- Viral haplotype reconstruction using third-generation sequencing (TGS) reads
- Accurate virus genome assembly using nanopore reads

We have on-going research projects on RNA viruses, phages, bacterial strain analysis in metagenomic data, plant genomics, etc. You can refer to the following publications for further details.
- Xubo Tang, Jiayu Shang, and Yanni Sun, "RdRp-based sensitive taxonomic classification of RNA viruses for metagenomic data", Briefings in Bioinformatics, accepted, 2022.

The methods/tools we use include: general algorithm design, machine learning methods, applied deep learning, data mining techniques, graph theories etc. You will be trained to handle BIG genomic data and solve high-impact research problems. The training will provide you with ample career opportunities.
- You should have training from Computer Science, Data Science, Electronic Engineering, BME, Bioinformatics, Statistics, or related fields
- You need to be familiar with some programming languages/data processing pipelines. I also welcome applicants with research experiences in microbiology even though you have limited experiences in programming 
- You should be highly motivated to study research problems you are interested in. I am happy to provide you with the freedom of choosing appropriate research topics. 
- If you have any questions, feel free to drop me a message (yannisun@cityu.edu.hk).

### I want you：
- Preferred majors: Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electronics Engineering, Statistics, BME, Bioinformatics. If you have sufficient programming training, other majors are fine too.
-  B.S. or M.S. gradutes welcome (本科或硕士学位均可申请)  
-  English: A minimum TOEFL score of 550 (paper-based) or 79 (internet-based) or 59 (revised paper-delivered test; sum of Reading, Listening, and Writing section scores); or a minimum overall band score of 6.5 in IELTS.
- Importantly, you need to be famialr with some programming languages. C/C++, or Python is a big plus.
- You should have strong curiosity for the research problems and are highly motivated to search for answers.
- To apply, please specify me as your advisor so that I can keep an eye on your publication.
- If you have any questions, feel free to drop me a message.
