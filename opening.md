When the human genome was sequenced more than a decade ago, people thought that we obtained the language of life. However, it turns out that this is not a language we understand! Our research goal is to apply computational models/methods to decypher the language of life. The methods/tools we use include: advanced data structures, general algorithm design, machine learning methods, applied deep learning, data mining techniques, graph theories etc. You will be trained to handle BIG genomic data and solve high-impact research problems. The training will provide you with ample career opportunities.

- Preferred majors: Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electronics Engineering, Statistics, BME, Bioinformatics. If you have sufficient programming training, other majors are fine too.
-  B.S. or M.S. gradutes welcome (本科或硕士学位均可申请)  
-  English: A minimum TOEFL score of 550 (paper-based) or 79 (internet-based) or 59 (revised paper-delivered test; sum of Reading, Listening, and Writing section scores); or a minimum overall band score of 6.5 in IELTS.
- Importantly, you need to be famialr with some programming languages. C/C++, or Python is a big plus.
- You should have strong curiosity for the research problems and are highly motivated to search for answers.
- To apply, please specify me as your advisor so that I can keep an eye on your publication.
- If you have any questions, feel free to drop me a message.
